## Hello

I'm a bioinformatician who works with mass spectrometry data. My did my PhD in glycomics and glycoproteomics, finding new ways to mix supporting information to dig deeper into complex biological samples.

Now, my day job involves using that knowledge to analyze immunopeptidomics data to help develop better cancer vaccines.

### :microscope: Active Projects
I'm actively working on these projects. They get updated frequently. Please contact me if you want to know more about them or if you find them useful!
- [glycresoft](https://github.com/mobiusklein/glycresoft): A glycan and glycopeptide LC-MS/MS search engine
- [ms_deisotope](https://github.com/mobiusklein/ms_deisotope): A mass spectrometry library for data access, signal processing, deisotoping, and charge state deconvolution suite.
   - Recent work done to deconvolute ion mobility data supporting Waters Cyclic IMS and Bruker TIMS-TOF data
- [glypy](https://github.com/mobiusklein/glypy): A glycoinformatics library for reading, writing, and manipulating glycans, as well as access to glycoinformatics resources around the web.


### Supporting Libraries
These libraries receive updates as needed, but their purpose is to serve my other active projects. If they look useful to you, please let me know.
- [psims](https://github.com/mobiusklein/glycresoft): Write HUPO PSI-MS mzML and mzIdentML XML formats.
- [brainpy](https://github.com/mobiusklein/brainpy): A library to generate coarse theoretical isotopic patterns.
- [ms_peak_picker](https://github.com/mobiusklein/ms_peak_picker): A low level library for signal processing of raw mass spectra
- [glycopeptidepy](https://github.com/mobiusklein/glycopeptidepy): A library to model glycopeptides and how they fragment. An extension to `glypy`.


I also contributed to:
